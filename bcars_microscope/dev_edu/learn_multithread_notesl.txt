Scenario 0 ()
0. NO PLOTTING
1. fcn AcquisitionStart called via signal
2. For loop in main thread that collects data 
3. ProcessEvents NOT called
4. Stop button checked for checked during for loop

Result:
50 Iterations Total Time: 0.000015 sec.
Mean 0.000000 +/- 0.000000 sec


Scenario 1 (see learn_multithread_basic):
1. fcn AcquisitionStart called via signal
2. For loop in main thread that collects data and plots
3. ProcessEvents NOT called
4. Stop button checked for checked during for loop

Result: 
1. Only plots once 
2. 50 Iterations Total Time: 1.400 sec.
   Mean 0.028 +/- 0.014 sec
3. Cannot stop during loop

Scenario 2 (see learn_multithread_basic_processevent):
1. Same as scenario 1, BUT ProcessEvents called

Result: 
1. Plots all 50 Iterations 
2.  50 Iterations Total Time: 1.318 sec.
    Mean 0.026 +/- 0.006 sec
3. Can stop during for loop 

Scenario 3 (see learn_multithread_plot_in_qtimer)
1. Plot update called from QTimer with interval 100 ms

Result:
1. 50 Iterations Total Time: 0.538 sec.
   Mean 0.011 +/- 0.037 sec
   Number of plots: 5
